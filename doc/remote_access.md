## Both Vim and R on the remote machine

The easiest way to run R on a remote machine is to log into the remote device
through ssh, start Vim, and run R in a Vim terminal (the default). You
will only need Vim and R configured as usual on the remote machine.

## Only R on the remote machine

However, if you need to start Vim on the local machine and run R on the remote
machine, a lot of additional configuration is required to enable full
communication between Vim and R because by default both Vim-R and vimcom only
accept TCP connections from the local host, and R saves temporary files in
the `/tmp` directory of the machine where it is running. To make the
communication between local Vim and remote R possible, the remote R has to
know the IP address of the local machine and one remote directory must be
mounted locally. Below is an example of how to achieve this goal.

  1. Set up the remote machine to accept ssh login from the local machine
     without a password (search for the command `ssh-copy-id` on the Internet
     to find out how to do it).

  2. Edit your `~/.Rprofile` on the remote machine (recommended):

       ```r
       options(vimcom.verbose = 2)
       library(colorout)
       ```


  3. At the local machine:

     - Make the directory `~/.remoteR`:

       ```sh
       mkdir ~/.remoteR
       ```

     - Create the shell script `~/bin/mountR` with the following contents, and
       make it executable (of course, replace `remotelogin` and `remotehost`
       with valid values for your case):

       ```sh
       #!/bin/sh
       sshfs remotelogin@remotehost:/home/remotelogin/.cache/Vim-R ~/.remoteR
       ```

     - Create the shell script `~/bin/sshR` with the following contents, and
       make it executable (replace `remotelogin` and `remotehost` with the
       real values):

       ```sh
       #!/bin/sh

       LOCAL_MOUNT_POINT=$VIMR_COMPLDIR
       REMOTE_CACHE_DIR=$VIMR_REMOTE_COMPLDIR
       REMOTE_LOGIN_HOST=remotelogin@remotehost

       NVIM_IP_ADDRESS=$(hostname -I)
       REMOTE_DIR_IS_MOUNTED=$(df | grep $LOCAL_MOUNT_POINT)

       if [ "x$REMOTE_DIR_IS_MOUNTED" = "x" ]
       then
           echo "RWarn: Remote directory '$REMOTE_CACHE_DIR' not mounted. Quit Vim and start it again.\x14"
           sshfs $REMOTE_LOGIN_HOST:$REMOTE_CACHE_DIR $LOCAL_MOUNT_POINT
           sync
           exit 153
       fi

       if [ "x$VIMR_PORT" = "x" ]
       then
           PSEUDOTERM='-T'
       else
           PSEUDOTERM='-t'
       fi

       ssh $PSEUDOTERM $REMOTE_LOGIN_HOST \
         "VIMR_TMPDIR=$REMOTE_CACHE_DIR/tmp \
         VIMR_COMPLDIR=$REMOTE_CACHE_DIR \
         VIMR_ID=$VIMR_ID \
         VIMR_SECRET=$VIMR_SECRET \
         R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES=$R_DEFAULT_PACKAGES \
         NVIM_IP_ADDRESS=$NVIM_IP_ADDRESS \
         VIMR_PORT=$VIMR_PORT R $*"
       ```

     - Add the following lines to your `vimrc`:

       ```vim
       let R_app = '/home/locallogin/bin/sshR'
       let R_cmd = '/home/locallogin/bin/sshR'
       let R_compldir = '/home/locallogin/.remoteR
       let R_remote_compldir = '/home/remotelogin/.cache/Vim-R'
       let R_local_R_library_dir = '/path/to/local/R/library' " where vimcom is installed
       ```

     - Mount the remote directory:

       ```sh
       ~/bin/mountR
       ```

     - Start Vim, and start R. The `vimcom` package should be automatically
       installed on the remote machine.

     - If vimcom is not automatically installed, you will have to
       manually build vimcom, copy the source to the remote machine, log into
       the remote machine, and install the package. Example:

       ```sh
       cd /tmp
       R CMD build /path/to/Vim-R/R/vimcom
       scp vimcom_0.9-149.tar.gz remotelogin@remotehost:/tmp
       ssh remotelogin@remotehost
       cd /tmp
       R CMD INSTALL vimcom_0.9-149.tar.gz
       ```
